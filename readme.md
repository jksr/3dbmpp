# 3DBMPP: 3D Beta-barrel Membrane Protein Predictor

### Overview:
Pipeline for 3D structure prediction for transmembrane beta barrel proteins (TMBs) or outer membrane proteins (OMPs).
The method was described in 
`High-resolution structure prediction of Î²-barrel membrane proteins.
W Tian, M Lin, K Tang, J Liang, H Naveed. 
*Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* 115 (7), 1511-1516`


### Note:
This software depends on rough information of secondary structure of a TMB.
This information can be obtained through 3rd-party software such as the ones listed in 
[http://www.ompdb.org/links.php](http://www.ompdb.org/links.php).

Due to the computation complexity, this package only provides the structure prediction for the barrel domains of the TMBs.
For the loop sampling mentioned in Tian *et. al*, please refer to

### Dependency:
This software depends the following python packages
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [biopython](https://biopython.org/)

and following software
* [BBQ algorithm]()**TODO**
* [Scwrl4]()**TODO**

### Usage:
